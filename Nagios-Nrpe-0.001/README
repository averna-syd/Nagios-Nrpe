This archive contains the distribution Nagios-Nrpe,
version 0.001:

  A small framework for custom Nagios NRPE client side checks. 
The main objective of these modules is to remove the repetitive boilerplate
required when making client side NRPE checks without hopefully adding in too
many dependencies.
